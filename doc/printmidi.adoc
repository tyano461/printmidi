[musixtex]

Generate a pdf from a tex file using pdflatex and musixtex and display it on the screen

Therefore,  a tex file will be needed to generate first.
For example, the generated tex file is as follows.

```tex
\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{article}
\usepackage{musixtex}

\begin{document}
    \begin{music}


\parindent10mm
\instrumentnumber{1} % a single instrument
\setname1{Piano} % whose name is Piano
\setstaffs1{2} % with two staffs
\generalmeter{\meterfrac44}% 4/4 meter chosen
\startextract % starting real score
\Notes\ibu0f0\qb0{cge}\tbu0\qb0g|\hl j\en
\Notes\ibu0f0\qb0{cge}\tbu0\qb0g|\ql l\sk\ql n\en

\Notes\ibu0f0\qb0{dgf}|\qlp i\en
\notes\tbu0\qb0g|\ibbl1j3\qb1j\tbl1\qb1k\en
\Notes\ibu0f0\qb0{cge}\tbu0\qb0g|\hl j\en
\endextract % terminate excerpt
\end{music}
\end{document}
```

### TeX

the following items running on iOS are required to convert from tex to pdf.

- pdflatex
- musixtex
- font for musixtex

pdflatex is to use the following.

https://github.com/holzschu/lib-tex

musixtex and font are platform-independent text files, so download and deploy the one of any platform.
